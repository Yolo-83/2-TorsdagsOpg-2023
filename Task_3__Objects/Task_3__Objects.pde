Small Processing-hack: If you have more than one tab and you get the error message "Cannot find a class or type named.." 
you can fix this by adding a setup() method to the "missing class/tab".

3.a Start a new sketch. Call it Task3. Create a new tab and give it the name "Datamatik".

3.b Create a new tab called "Teacher" and another one called "Student". 
You should now see three new files in your sketch folder, called Datamatik.pde, Teacher.pde and Student.pde.

3.c In the Student tab, declare the class "Student" 
and add 4 global variables: "name", "age", "isFemale", "datamatikerTeam" using appropriate data types for each.

3.d In the Student class, add a constructor that takes in 4 parameters with the names 
"tmpName", "tmpAge", "tmpIsFemale", "tmpDatamatikerTeam" with the same data types used for global variables in 3.c

3.e In the constructor, assign the values of the parameters to the global variables created in 3.c.

3.f In the Teacher tab, declare the class "Teacher" and add 3 global variables: "name", "age", "isFemale", 
using appropriate data types for each.

3.g In the Teacher class, add a constructor that takes in 3 parameters with the names 
"tmpName", "tmpAge", "tmpIsFemale" with the same datatypes used in 3.f

3.h Populate the variables created in 3.f with the parameters of the constructor added in 3.g 
(this means that you assign the value of the parameters to the variables, like you did in 3.e)

3.i Returning to the Datamatik class, add a setup() function and in this function 
create a new object/instance of the type Teacher and give it the name, age and gender of your teacher.

3.j Also in the setup() function of Datamatik, create two new objects/instances of the type Student. 
The first one, with your own name, age and gender. 
The second one with the name, age and gender of a student in your study group.

3.k in the setup() function print the name of the teacher

3.l in the setup() function print the names of both students and which teams they are from.
