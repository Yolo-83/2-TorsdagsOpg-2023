You will need your Datamatik and Student tab from task 3. If you have created a new sketch for task 5, 
you can copy the files Datamatik.pde and Student.pde from the folder Task3 (or whatever sketch you used to do task 3) 
to the folder Task4 (or whatever you named the sketch you are using for this task)

4.a In the Teacher class, make a function called changeName. 
The function should have the returntype void and take a String newName as parameter. 
The function should change the global variable name to the newName given as argument to the function when called.

4.b In your setup() function from 3.i you must now change the name of your Teacher-object, 
by calling the method changeName() with a new name.

4.c Print the name of the teacher in the setup() method again to see if it has changed.
